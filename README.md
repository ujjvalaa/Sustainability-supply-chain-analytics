***Introduction**
Welcome to the Supply Chain Sustainability Report project, a practical guide for calculating and visualizing CO2 emissions in your distribution network. 
This project is intended to assist organizations in addressing the growing demands for transparency in sustainable development from both investors and customers. 
The focus here is on the calculation of CO2 emissions, particularly Scope 3 emissions related to downstream transportation, providing a valuable resource for assessing and improving the environmental impact of your distribution network.

***Data Processing***
This project is structured into three core sections: data collection, data processing, and CO2 emission calculations. In the "Data Collection" section, you will find guidance on how to gather the essential datasets, including shipped order lines and unit of measure conversions. The "Data Processing" segment outlines the crucial steps for data cleaning, transformation, and organization, setting the stage for accurate CO2 emission calculations. By following these steps, you will be well-prepared to determine the carbon footprint of your supply chain.

***Visualization and Contribution***
To create impactful sustainability reports, this project guides you on using PowerBI for data visualization. This empowers you to craft informative reports effectively. Additionally, contributions from the open-source community are encouraged. If you're interested in enhancing or expanding this project, comprehensive guidelines for contributions, including pull requests and issue reporting, are available. This project adheres to an open-source license, making it a valuable tool for organizations looking to address investor and customer demands for sustainability transparency and make informed decisions regarding their supply chain's environmental impact.
